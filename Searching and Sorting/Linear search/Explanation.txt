Linear search:

Linear Search is a simple search algorithm used to find a specific element in an array. 
It checks each element of the array one by one until the target value is found or the end of the array is reached.

Approach:

1. Begin at the first element of the array.
2. Check if the current element equals the target value.
3. If they are equal, return the index of that element.
4. If the entire array is checked without a match, return -1.

Dry run: 

arr = [4, 5, 1, 3, 9]
target = 3

Iteration 1:

i = 0 → arr[0] = 4
4 == 3 ? → No

Iteration 2:

i = 1 → arr[1] = 5
5 == 3 ? → No

Iteration 3:

i = 2 → arr[2] = 1
1 == 3 ? → No

Iteration 4:

i = 3 → arr[3] = 3
3 == 3 ? → Yes → return 3

After Function Call

result = 3

console.log("Element found at index", result);

Output: Element found at index 3
