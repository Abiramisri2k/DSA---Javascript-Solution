Problem Statement:

Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.
Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. 
Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

Approach:

1. Use a Set to track visited nodes.
2. While traversing, if we encounter a node already in the set, we’ve found a cycle.
3. If we reach null, there’s no cycle.


Dry run:

Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
           ↑           ↓
           ← ← ← ← ← ← ←

Step 1:

curr = 1
seenNodes = {} → doesn’t have 1
Add 1 → seenNodes = {1}
Move curr = 2

Step 2:

curr = 2
seenNodes = {1} → doesn’t have 2
Add 2 → seenNodes = {1, 2}
Move curr = 3

Step 3:

curr = 3
seenNodes = {1,2} → doesn’t have 3
Add 3 → seenNodes = {1,2,3}
Move curr = 4

Step 4:

curr = 4
seenNodes = {1,2,3} → doesn’t have 4
Add 4 → seenNodes = {1,2,3,4}
Move curr = 5

Step 5:

curr = 5
seenNodes = {1,2,3,4} → doesn’t have 5
Add 5 → seenNodes = {1,2,3,4,5}
Move curr = 2 (because of the cycle)

Step 6:

curr = 2
seenNodes = {1,2,3,4,5} → already has 2
Return true

Output:
true
